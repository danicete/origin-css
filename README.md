# Origin CSS

Origin's primary objective is not to be another component library—there are many great options already available—but instead it is a holistic framework that serves as the structural foundation for your CSS.

## Goals

- Project structuring system that reduces dependencies and promotes abstractions
- Minimal code generation, only output what you intend to use
- Naming conventions constructed to be human readable, meaningfully divisioned, and non-conflictual
- Simplifies the relationship between HTML classes and CSS
- Easily extendable; keeps dependancies clear
